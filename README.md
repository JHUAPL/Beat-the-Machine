# Beat the Machine - Reverse Engineering Basics in Puzzle Form

Beat the Machine is a workshop designed to introduce students to concepts in software reverse engineering (binary, hexadecimal, disassembly) on paper, without the need for computer & software setup.  Target audience is middle school-to-college students who have had programming exposure (some familiarity with binary and hexadecimal is encouraged).

## Mostly Optical Simple Instruction Set (MOSIS)
MOSIS is a simple 16-bit instruction set designed to be easily disassembled by hand, while still resembling a real-world architecture.  Most instructions fields are a single nybble (4 bits, 1 hexadecimal digit) - making disassembly straightforward once the binary is converted to hexadecimal.

## Exercise Worksheets
* *Easy* - Exercises contain binary, hexadecimal instructions, disassembly. Students analyze the disassembly to solve problems.
* *Medium* - Exercises contain binary, hexadecimal instructions.  Students disassemble using instruction set documentation and analyze diassembly to solve problems.
* *Hard* - Exercises contain binary.  Students convert to hexadecimal, disassemble using instruction set documentation, and analyze disassembly to solve problems.
